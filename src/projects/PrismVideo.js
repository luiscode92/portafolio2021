                In this project, I helped conduct interviews of experienced video creators and enhanced the usability of various video editing features, optimizing them for a larger user pool. The app hit #1 in the Google Play Store Trending Apps list for the Korean market in May 2019.

          <div className="content middle">PRISM Live Studio is a video creator app with which you can create live streams or edit videos. In the video editing mode, you can create unique content by applying various effects to your video such as stickers, filters, and captions. Nearly 600 videos are created with PRISM each day.</div>

          <div className="content-title-second">Expanding Target Users to Vlog Creators</div>
          <div className="content middle">After the initial launch of the video editing features, we validated the usability of the app through interviews of video creators. The interviewees could be classified into two groups; short clips creators and vlog creators. Through the interview, we learned that the latter found the current usability insufficient for their needs, and identified opportunities to include these users in our target group.</div>

          <div className="content-title-second">The Need to Provide Detailed Editing Features</div>
          <div className="content end">Many of the vlog creators we interviewed shared the following characteristics :<br/><br/>
          • They frequently needed to go back and modify effects that they had placed earlier.<br/>
          • They wished to place effects precisely at a certain timestamp.<br/>
          • They preferred clean layouts and small graphics that helped you focus on the main content, rather than bold effects and transitions.<br/><br/>
          We learned that we needed to provide a more delicate editing experience for these users, and added flows that allowed the re-modification and fine tuning of effects.</div>

            <div className="quote"><img src={img04} alt="Quotation Mark" className="quote-image"/><span className="quote-text">I wanted to place this filter at the start of the second clip.</span></div>
            <div className="content middle">Prior to the interview, you could not adjust the timeline of effects once they had been applied. We made it possible to adjust the start and end points of any effect.</div>
            <img src={img05} alt="Timeline Example" className="image end"/>
          </div>
          <div className="redesign-background">
            <div className="content-title">Text Modification</div>
            <div className="quote"><img src={img04} alt="Quotation Mark" className="quote-image"/><span className="quote-text">When I realized that some of the text was covering the scene, I had no way to go back and make it shorter.</span></div>
            <div className="content middle">The text feature was very important to vloggers, as they used it to add subtitles to their videos. We noticed that a lot of users wanted to go back and modify earlier subtitles, so the story flowed nicely together as a whole. We did not support the re-editing of text at the time, so we devised a flow that made this possible.</div>
            <img src={img06} alt="Text Example" className="image end"/>
          </div>
          <div className="redesign-background">
            <div className="content-title">Improved Volume Controls</div>
            <div className="quote"><img src={img04} alt="Quotation Mark" className="quote-image"/><span className="quote-text">I usually mute the scenes where I'm talking with my friends, and fast forward through them.</span></div>
            <div className="content middle">Most vlogs use background music. When using music, it is important that the music is balanced out with the original audio. We made it easier to adjust the volume levels for each clip, and added mute functionality.</div>

            <div className="quote"><img src={img04} alt="Quotation Mark" className="quote-image"/><span className="quote-text">I usually use a simple background for my horizontal videos, like black or white.</span></div>
            <div className="content middle">In the previous version, any empty space was defaulted to a larger, blurred version of the video. However, vlog creators found the effect distracting, as it prevented the viewers from focusing on the content. We learned that we needed solid background options, and created a palette of 25 colors including black and white.</div>

            <div className="content-title">Easier Uploading to Platforms</div>
            <div className="content middle">Instead of using the system share layer (which included irrelevant options such as memo pads and storage apps), we created a custom share menu that narrowed the options down into a selection of SNS platforms that users were more likely to upload to. We also added App2App sharing for a quicker and smoother sharing experience.</div>
