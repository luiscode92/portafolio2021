                In this project, I redesigned the core layout of the app to scale for future implementations. Throughout the process, I was careful to balance the usability, business, and technical goals. The layout was proved easy to use by multiple users in an interview conducted shortly after the release.

            Although the scenes and filters were located in the same panel, they were associated with different parts of the screen. Scenes had to do with the whole screen, while filters were applied to the sub-items of the screen. Was there a way to make this relationship easier to understand?

          <div className="content middle concept-a display">For Concept A, I tried preserving the existing usability as best as I could. I created a layout in which a small toolbar menu would pop up when a source was clicked, that showed the various effects available at hand.</div>

              <div className="proscons-content">This seemed like the obvious answer at first, as users would be able to adjust to the changes quickly. It was also a method used by Lightstream, a major player in this area.</div>

              <div className="proscons-title">CONS</div>
              <div className="proscons-content">However, the current structure did not make it possible to add any type of control above the screen area. Also, this concept was not scalable for the growth of each effect category.</div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div className="content middle concept-b">The general idea of Concept B was that you could click on each source to expose a layer in the sources panel that showed you the various effect options that you could use on that particular source.</div>

              <div className="proscons-content">If one effect category expanded, the user would have no choice but to scroll down to access the other effects. Also, the panel hid the frequently used hide / show source button.</div>

          </div>
          <div className="content middle concept-c">Finally, for Concept C, I tried moving the scenes panel to the left, and dedicating the bottom area to effects. Considering that the average user about 4 scenes at most, and up to 4 sources per scene, I was confident that the change would not affect the usability of the scenes and sources panels.</div>

              <div className="proscons-title">PROS</div>
              <div className="proscons-content">Concept C was better than Concept B in that it did not harm the usability for any existing features. It was also easier with this layout to view all of the effect options at hand.</div>

            <div className="proscons-cons">
              <div className="proscons-title">CONS</div>
              <div className="proscons-content">However, it seemed inefficient to have the effects menu open at all times, considering it was not a crucial part of streaming. The horizontal scroll also made it hard to align the controls.</div>

            After comparing these three, my team and I decided to develop Concept C, as it did not lessen the usability for any of the exisiting controls, and had the best scalability for expansion of each effect library.<br/><br/>
            After many more iterations, I managed to solve the drawbacks C had had; such as :
